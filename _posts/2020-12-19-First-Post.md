Quick Draft of My Blog Post

Hello, this is my first blog post. I'm not much of a blogger, but I want to get the most out of my GitHub experience so I'm exploring some of the tools and utilities.
My goal is to use github as a project repository and put my coding chops on the web for inclusion in job applications.
Well, nice chatting with you. Now it's time to get busy building code!

Talk soon,
Johnny
